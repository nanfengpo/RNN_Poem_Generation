# RNN_Poem_Generation
Using dynamic and static Recurrent neural network to generate Chinese poems respectively. In order to make the structure more general, a class of tensorflow graph model was created to do the training and testing work. The final results looked fantastic, at least the styles matched ancient Chinese poem norms.

- Dataset: Chinese peoms, https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o7QlUhO
